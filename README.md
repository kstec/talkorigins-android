# talkorigins-android


talkorigins-android is an effort to port the talk.origins archive to an easily readable format on an Android device

The TalkOrigins archive has a lot of great information, but is rather hard to read on an Android phone due to the sheer volume of content.

This project's goal is to create parsers to crawl the content, and provide it to a clean UI in an Android app for quick reference.

So far, all of the content at http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html is available through this app.
